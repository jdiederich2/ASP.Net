        <p>Welcome to Force Fitness! I have always found the imagery of the Jedi to be
        engaging and inspiring. The combination of mystic devotion, discipline, and martial
        skill appeals to me. It has a certain allure. Why the combination with fitness you may
        ask? I'm glad you did. For the first time in history we, as a culture, face an epidemic
        of obesity. Millions of people, unhappy with their unhealthy condition or their appearance,
        are desperately trying to get fit. Most of us succeed only in the short term, if at all.
        Which is to say, most of us fail.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the greatest obstacle we face in achieving our fitness goals is simply that
        we attempt to pursue a permanent solution by temporary means. We need to come to the
        foundational realization that, for most of us, it is our lifestyle that has brought
        us to our current state. The very things that cause us to be overweight, the very things that
        make us unhealthy have become not only entrenched habits, they have become part of our 
        very identity. We can never change the consequences of lifestyle or identity by following
        a temporary diet or exercise plan.</p>
        
        <p>For many of us the idea that we must pursue a permanent change of lifestyle is 
        beyond daunting. It conjures up images of never getting to eat the foods we like, 
        living on a diet of boring, unappetizing foods, and constant hunger. We imagine
        that this means unending drudgery on a treadmill for hours every week, forever.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          This isn't just about changing your lifestyle, it is about changing your identity
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The quest for fitness will undoubtedly involve hardship, all worthwhile quests do.
        It will be difficult, sometimes it may even seem impossible. Most things worth doing are.
        This isn't just about changing your lifestyle, it is about changing your identity. It is 
        about becoming something and someone new. If you take on the lifestyle of an active person
        but you remain your same old sedentary self, the result is you will hate your life. You will
        not be able to sustain the change for long. Rather you must become a person who enjoys activity
        and only then will you be able to truly change your life.</p>
        
        <p>Here is where my fascination with Jedi, Warrior-monks, Knights, and Samurai comes in.
        You have to decide what kind of person you want to become. If I am going to go through all
        the trouble of pursuing transformation, I'm going to try to become something I find really 
        awesome! Thus my quest for fitness is inspired by the imagery and ethos of the Jedi.

        <p>Proper nutrition is the foundation of fitness. Exercise and strength training
        are indispensable, but no amount of exercise can overcome bad eating habits. There
        is a common quote in the fitness industry, <q>you can't outrun your fork</q> and
        this is absolutely true. As a result, every quest for fitness must begin by making
        new eating habits. Go to the <a href="nutritionInfo.html">nutrition page</a> to
        learn more about eating for fitness.</p>

        <p>Exercise and strength training are critical to fitness body transformation.
        While eating habits are the single biggest factor in weight gain and weight loss,
        Exercise and particularly strength training can help determine what kind of weight
        you gain or lose. In other words, are you gaining/losing fat? or muscle?
        In addition, exercise and strength training have significant benefits for appearance,
        performance, and general health. Check out the <a href="exerciseInfo.html">exercise page</a>
