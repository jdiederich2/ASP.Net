          <p>Exercise and Diet are often thought of as the twin pillars of fitness. This is true to a certain degree
          and there are compelling reasons why it is important to always include exercise in your fitness program.
          However, proper eating habits are the bedrock foundation upon which fitness must be built. There is a 
          saying in the fitness community that <q>you can't outrun your fork</q>. No matter how much you exercise, 
          you will never be able to exercise enough to make up for bad eating habits.</p>
          
          <p>You may notice that I have used the phrase eating habits more than the word diet. This is a deliberate 
          choice to reflect the fact that pursuing temporary diets will never bring real success. The real success
          that we are pursuing is not simply a number on a scale, or even an appearance in the mirror, it is transformation.
          We are not seeking only to appear different, but to be different.</p>

          <p>This means that we are not looking for a temporary diet that will let us return to our old ways and 
          habits a few weeks down the road. We are looking to build a whole new identity with food. We don't want
          to simply restrain our food desires for a while, we want to build new food desires.</p>
